# American Football Formations :football:

This repository contains the American Football formations in the [SVG format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics).
The use of SVG makes it easy to integrate it in your website or application, regardless of the required size.

## Status
Currently, adding new formations as I encounter them.
If you want a specific formation, just create an issue :smile: and I'll try to create it.
If you want to add a formation you've created yourself, just send me a pull request.

## Free for All
You can use the SVG files for free! More information in `LICENSE`.
